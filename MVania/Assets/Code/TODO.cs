// - save relevant data when starting new file
// - handle UI manager in better way (fixed for now but could look into this some more later)
// - look over respawning when game over( halfdone, only need to rearite how to handle death when not having reacht a savepoint yet )
// - add invinsibility frames on taking damage and some debug effect to this
// - add knockback on hit
// - need to stop velocity when dying(tex if dashing when dying we are in couroutine that keeps adding velocity even if we disable script?)
// - pause menu with quitgame option, this code is in playerhealth update now with H for command
// - give healthbar functionality for incresing max health and serialize/ deserialize this
// - make permanent health increase pickups and show how many picked up on savefile images in loadgame menu, pickups objects need to be saved in Gameprogressmanager
// - show lines for cameraclamps in editor to better visualize what the camera can see in a room
